The Rubin Observatory telescope will revolutionize astronomy, enabling the creation of the universe's broadest and deepest survey. Celestial objects and their properties will be cataloged in a trillions-entry database. Qserv, a specific database software, is actively developed by a team at Stanford University and Fabrice. We'll introduce the Qserv operator, deploying it in seconds on thousands of nodes via the operator-sdk framework. This includes both conventional architecture at IN2P3 Computing Center and Cloud Computing.

We'll elaborate on controlling and supervising algorithms through Kubernetes and the ArgoWorkflow framework, ensuring automatic and reproducible loading of millions of files and terabytes of cosmological data into Qserv within minutes. The presentation will conclude by outlining our roadmap, targeting the ingestion of hundreds of millions of files and petabytes of data.
