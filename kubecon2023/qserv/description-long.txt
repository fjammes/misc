The Rubin Observatory telescope is set to revolutionize astronomy. It will enable the creation of the broadest and deepest survey of the universe. Celestial objects and their physical properties will be identified and cataloged in a database that will ultimately consist of trillions of entries. With a volume of several tens of petabytes, this catalog will play a major role in the scientific exploitation of the data produced by the telescope.

To meet this need, a specific database software named Qserv is actively being developed by a team of about ten experts based at Stanford University in the United States, including Igor and Fritz, and by Fabrice. We will introduce the Qserv operator, based on the operator-sdk framework, which allows the deployment and orchestration of this distributed database in a matter of seconds on thousands of nodes, both in conventional architecture at the IN2P3 Computing Center and in Cloud Computing.

Furthermore, we will detail how Gabriele control and supervise, through Kubernetes and the ArgoWorkflow framework, the algorithms that enable the automatic and reproducible loading of millions of files and terabytes of cosmological data into Qserv within minutes. We will conclude by presenting our roadmap, which aims to ingest hundreds of millions of files and petabytes of data.
